- **Update Accommodation**: Edit key details of existing housing (address, name, description, etc.)
- **Delete Accommodation**: Fully remove a housing listing and related data
- **Authorization**: Only users with the `OWNER` role can perform actions
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Explore and test endpoints via Swagger UI
- **Token Verification**: Verifies JWT token via an external authentication microservice
- **Test Coverage > 80%**: All routes and edge cases are unit tested
